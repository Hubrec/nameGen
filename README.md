# NameGen

## Project presentation

I realized this project for fun and entertainement. The app offers some features, for example generating namge with your own set of data or generating your own database of generated names in a .txt file lit there is in [here](./ressources/nameLists/). 
The algorithm uses a probability calculation that a letter arrives after another and chooses one at random weighted by the probability that it arrives.
